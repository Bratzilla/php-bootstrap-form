### PHP Bootstrap Form helper
Project is fork of PFBC/PHP Form Builder Class (http://code.google.com/p/php-form-builder-class/). The main differences of the original branch and a fork are:

1. Bootstrap 3 support
2. Added 'shared' element property to share 1 row between multiple elements in SideBySide View
3. View class renamed to FormView class
4. Added Form::renderArray() helper function
5. Fixed prepend and append properties handling

Planned features:

1. Add Form::renderGroup() to render part of the form
2. Create documentation :)

See old documentation on http://www.imavex.com/pfbc3.x-php5/ . New documentation is coming.
